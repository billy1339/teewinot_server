post1 = Post.create({title: 'Reflection: The Partnership of Military and Computers', body: 'The reading from Paul Edwards, The Closed War, titled ‘Why Build Computers?: The Military Role in Computer Research’ discusses the interaction between the military and technology. The relationship between the military and technology can be seen in three distinct periods: pre-war, war, and post-war. The pre-war technologies such as the airplane facilitated the need for mathematical ballistics tests, while the war period saw the full United States effort in making war technologies and the massive amounts of computations needed for their implementation, and the post-war, Cold War period saw an explosion of computing needs for the technological fight against the USSR. The reading dives into the reasons behind the partnership of the military and computing and some of the social and cultural effects of that partnership. The Military’s use and need of computing originates directly from the desire for ballistics tables. The Military advancements made in the pre-war period facilitated this need. The Military needed to accurately drop bombs, shoot down airplanes, and shoot large guns with precision. In order to accomplish those feats massive amounts of computational analysis was required. One of the major government subsidiaries involved with this was the Ballistics Research Lab (BRL). Working under the BRL was the Moore School who used human computers and the Differential Analyzer to complete these ballistics tables. The problem was that the completion of ballistics tables was painfully slow even with the Differential Analyzers. John Mauchly and John Eckert propose the ENIAC, which would be a computer able to compute these tables at a fraction of the time. The government expended a huge sum of money on this project, which was only finished after the war. The ENIAC did not go on to make ballistics tables for the war but was an important foundation for the computer and led to the EDVAC, which laid the framework for the computer as we know today. The ENIAC represented a partnership between the scientists and the Military, and “[w]ithout the vast research funding and the atmosphere of desperation associated with the war, it probably would have been years, perhaps decades, before private industry attempted such a project” (Edwards, 51). The wartime alliance between the Military and science, represented through projects such as ENIAC and the Manhattan Project, was an alliance that would last even once the war was over. The need to technologically advance ahead of the USSR during the Cold War kept the government coffers open. Immediately following the war the government set up a plethora of offices and organizations to keep the research going. These organizations usually had broad mandates for technological advancements. The Office of Naval Research was set up to maintain future naval power, The Department of Energy was responsible for atomic weapons research, and NASA devoted resources to rocket and missile technologies. All of these organizations had the same underlying need for the ability to process large amounts of data and calculations. This brings us back to the ENIAC and funding the government devoted towards computing. The funding for research was even given to large corporations who were devoted to computing tasks. In order for technological advancements to be made, progress in the field of computing also needed to be made. The Military’s need for computing and computers stems beyond the needs discussed above. Computers were seen as a tool that could automate and accelerate military tasks. Some in the military saw the automation of the battlefield a reality in the very near future and viewed the computer as vital to C3I or command, control, communications, and intelligence networks. Just as the Military was hesitant to use the radio in its early days, the Military was hesitant in regards to an ‘automated battlefield’ and as so the ‘automated battlefield’ is no a reality. This did not take away from the Military’s need for huge computational abilities and as so, they kept their partnership with science and the computer strong. Paul Edwards chapter relates to some of the other readings that we have done in class. Most notably the chapter relates to Susan J. Douglas’s article on the Navy’s adoption of the radio. She writes that there were many barriers for the radio to cross before being fully implemented by the Navy. The Navy was hesitant to change and as so the implementation was difficult. The Edwards chapter does not discuss the barriers for technological implementation but more so the partnership of the Military and technology. One could trace the partnership of the Military and technology back to the 19th century with the technological implementation of items such as the radio. Edwards chapter implies that the need for quick and accurate computing pushed the Military to form an alliance with science and technology on a scale not previously seen, and an alliance that truly has not ended. Concluding the presentation on this chapter a question was brought up for discussion among the class. The question went something like “Who do you think is a better investor in R&D, the private sector or the government?” The class gave a number of great answers, but the question really got me thinking about what the proportion of ‘major’ technological innovations have been created as a result of government funding and more so how many of those came in the 20 years or so following WW2. Edwards says that it would have taken much longer for the ENIAC to be created without the government funding and the atmosphere present at the time. More so, is a major war and the national movement that ensues important if not vital for major technological breakthroughs. In the chapter Edwards quotes Frank Rose who says, “the computerization of society…has essentially been a side effect of the computerization of war” (Edwards, 65). This quote begs the question, would our society be so computer oriented if there was not the partnership between the Military and computing during the war and the following period? To my knowledge these are all unanswerable questions, but they provide some food for thought. I think that the intertwined nature of technology and the Military, and more so computing and the Military was vital to industry breakthroughs. I also think that the war atmosphere is an important variable when thinking of computer breakthroughs. This is because a war atmosphere brings with it a sense of desperation and necessity. Overall I thought the article was very interesting and it sparked my interest in regards to the role of technology in the Military and the impact it made.

post2 = Post.create({title: 'What will the future hold?', body: 'How can one predict the future when it is uncertain? Those who end up being right are often times seen as lunatics in real time and so why do people try? Well there are those who see the future as an unmolded piece of clay that is prime and ripe for driven individuals to shape. Some believe that you cannot predict the future, however, I like to take the stand that you can predict the future because everyone has the ability to mold the future in ways you want. Writing as a visionary thinker, I have some predictions of what the future will hold. First off, everything that is not currently automated will be. One can look to the past to see an abundance of dull aspects of human life that have been automated and replaced with algorithms; customer service, music choices, and even news articles are examples of this automation that has already happened. The low hanging fruit has already been plucked and now the rest of the fruit will be automated. The difficult ones are yet to come; banking, education, and travel are a few of these examples. Already you can get into one of Google’s driverless car’s and travel on the highway and around town without ever having to put your foot on the accelerator; in fact they do not even have peddles or a steering wheel. Everything still left to automate will be. The machine age was all about increasing the physical strength of humans; instead of having ten people dig a foundation one can do it in half the time with a backhoe. In the future, I believe instead of increasing the physical strength of humans, innovators will look for ways to increase the power of our minds. The Internet, although not directly increasing the minds capabilities, has increased the information that individuals have access to. This gives the individual the capacity to know almost anything at anytime, almost anywhere. The Internet has been around for quite some time and I think it was the beginning of the mind enhancing age. Mankind is beginning to enhance the capabilities of the mind and in the future these capabilities will only be enhanced. The third and final future prediction I hold has to do with medical technology. The field of medicine has come leaps and bounds in the past century or so and has moved at a rapid pace in the recent past. I believe that the most profound discoveries will come with the pairing of the computer and biology in the field of bioinformatics. Bioinformatics holds tremendous promise because it uses the power of the computer to analyze biological data. I believe that monumental discoveries could be made, and at a faster pace than was ever possible in the past. Water, renewable energy, environment. In sum the macro fields where I think entrepreneurs will take the future are: automation, the mind, and bioinformatics. As a possible philosophy we should take the approach of trying to mold the future, mold it to ensure that mankind can live a long, happy, and prosperous life.', author: 'Scarlet Johanson', passcode: 'hello1234'})
